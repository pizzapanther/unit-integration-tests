Here is my Google Home Django app!

You can say a phrase, and Yoda will respond to you with a translation in Yoda-Speak.

But there's more!

Ask Yoda "What can I say?" or "options" and Yoda will list out the different conversational options you have, but you have a rudimentary understanding of Yoda-Speak to make use of any of them because, well, he's Yoda, so it's going to be in Yoda-Speak!

You can also say " Hey Yoda", and the current conversation will restart at the beginning.

If you are tired of talking to Yoda, then just say "end", "finish" or "stop" and the conversation will be aborted.

Have fun, and may the Force be with you!

# Testing Exercises

## Day 1: Unit and Integration Tests

Take a previous project and add at least one of each of the following:

- Unit Test
  - *Note: You may need to refactor your code to isolate a specific function to test*
- Integration Test
- Test that mocks an API call

## Day 2: Continuous Integration

- Take one of your existing projects and add CircleCI to run your tests automatically.
- Setup your branches so they must pass tests before they can be merged into the master branch.

## Day 2: End to End Testing

- Write at least one E2E test for an existing project.
- Setup your E2E test to run on CircleCI
